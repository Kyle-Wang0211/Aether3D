ci(ssot-foundation): add comprehensive Linux compatibility and preventive guardrails

SSOT-Change: yes

## Changes

### Linux Compatibility Fixes
- Added cross-platform crypto shim (CryptoShim.swift) for SHA-256 hashing
- Updated EnumFrozenOrderTests to use CryptoShim instead of direct CryptoKit import
- Added swift-crypto dependency to ConstantsTests target for Linux support

### Preventive Guardrails
- Added ban_apple_only_imports.sh script to detect Apple-only imports in Linux-compiled targets
- Integrated Apple-only import check into repo_hygiene.sh
- Enhanced validate_ssot_gate_test_selection.sh to include CryptoShimConsistencyTests
- Added toolchain version check to preflight_ssot_foundation.sh

### Tests
- Added CryptoShimConsistencyTests.swift (13 tests) validating cross-platform SHA-256 consistency
- Included CryptoShimConsistencyTests in Gate 2 test selection
- Updated workflow to include CryptoShimConsistencyTests in Gate 2 filters

### Documentation
- Updated DEVELOPER_FAILURE_TRIAGE.md with Ubuntu CryptoKit failure handling
- Added SHA-256 output mismatch troubleshooting guide
- Updated FINAL_LOCAL_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md with future breakage threat model

## Invariants Preserved
- No algorithms added (contracts/constants/tests/docs/scripts only)
- Append-only + version-explicit preserved
- All SSOT Foundation invariants (A1-A5, B1-B3, CE, CL2, etc.) unchanged
- Cross-platform determinism maintained

## Testing
- ✅ All SSOT Foundation tests pass (101 tests, 0 failures)
- ✅ Gate 1 tests pass (debug + release)
- ✅ Gate 2 tests pass (debug + release, includes CryptoShimConsistencyTests)
- ✅ Linux equivalence smoke passes
- ✅ All guardrail scripts pass
- ✅ Workflow validation passes

## Impact
- Fixes Linux CI failures: "no such module 'CryptoKit'"
- Prevents future Apple-only import regressions via guardrails
- Ensures cross-platform crypto consistency via dedicated tests
- Improves CI reliability with comprehensive validation

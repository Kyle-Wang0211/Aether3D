## Source of Truth (SSOT)

The following documents are the ONLY authoritative sources of truth for this repository.
No authority may be inferred from file names, directory names, versions, or legacy markers.

### Global SSOT Documents

- docs/WHITEBOX.md
- docs/ACCEPTANCE.md
- docs/WORKFLOW.md
- docs/ROLLBACK.md

### Constitution Documents

The directory docs/constitution/ is an active working directory.
HOWEVER, files inside it are NOT automatically authoritative.

Only documents explicitly listed in:
- docs/constitution/INDEX.md

are considered authoritative constitutional specifications.

### Non-Inference Rule (Critical)

Authority MUST NOT be inferred from:
- File name patterns (e.g. "legacy", "copy", " 2", version strings)
- Directory placement
- Historical usage

SSOT is explicit only.

### Archive Notice

All content under docs/_archive/ is historical and NOT authoritative.
Archived documents exist only for reference and audit purposes.

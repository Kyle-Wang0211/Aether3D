## Top-Level Directories

## Top-Level Directories

- `App/`: 6 files
- `Assets.xcassets/`: 3 files
- `Core/`: 32 files
- `Features/`: 4 files
- `docs/`: 19 files
- `scripts/`: 2 files
- `server/`: 33 files

## Empty Directories (containing only .gitkeep)

- `Features/`

## Risk Assessment

### Directories That May Still Be in Xcode Target Membership

⚠️ **Manual Check Required**: The following directories may still be referenced in Xcode project targets:

- `Core/Camera/` - Check Build Phases → Compile Sources
- `Core/PointCloud/` - Check Build Phases → Compile Sources
- `Core/Training/` - Check Build Phases → Compile Sources (may contain Shaders/)
- `Features/` - Check Build Phases → Compile Sources (may contain subdirectories)

### Pre-Deletion Verification Actions

Before deleting any directory, verify:

1. **Core/Training/**: Check for shader files:
   ```bash
   find Core/Training -type f -name '*.metal' -o -name '*.glsl' -o -name '*.shader'
   ```
   - If shader files exist: DO NOT DELETE. Move Shaders/ to appropriate location first.
   - If empty or only .gitkeep: Safe to delete.

2. **Features/**: Check Xcode Compile Sources:
   - Open Xcode project
   - Navigate to Build Phases → Compile Sources
   - Search for 'Features/' in the list
   - If found: DO NOT DELETE. Remove from target first.
   - If not found: Safe to delete.

3. **Core/Camera/ and Core/PointCloud/**: Check if empty:
   ```bash
   find Core/Camera Core/PointCloud -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v '.gitkeep'
   ```
   - If output is empty: Safe to delete.
   - If files found: DO NOT DELETE.

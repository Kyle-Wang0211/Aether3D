# Repository Inventory

This document is generated by `scripts/generate_inventory.sh` and manually completed
where v1.3 requires human verification.

Its purpose is to provide a **stable, reviewable inventory baseline**
before structural deletions, CI gates, and constitution-level enforcement.

---

## 1. Top-Level Directory Summary (Required by v1.3)

The following is a snapshot of top-level directories and their approximate file counts
at the time of generation. Counts include tracked source files only.

| Directory | File Count | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| `App/` | 6 | iOS app entry & demo UI |
| `Assets.xcassets/` | 3 | Asset catalog |
| `Core/` | 32 | Core logic, pipelines, invariants |
| `Features/` | 4 | Currently empty or placeholder |
| `docs/` | 19 | Constitution & documentation |
| `scripts/` | 2 | Repo tooling & CI helpers |
| `server/` | 33 | Python backend (not part of Xcode build) |

> ⚠️ File counts are informational only and **not used for gating**.

---

## 2. Empty Directories (Only `.gitkeep`)

The following directories currently contain **no tracked files except `.gitkeep`**:

- `Features/`

These directories are candidates for deletion **only after**
confirming they are not referenced by any build target.

---

## 3. Xcode Target Membership Risk Assessment (Required by v1.3)

### Directories That May Still Be in Xcode Target Membership

⚠️ **Manual Verification Required**

The following directories may still be referenced in Xcode targets
even if they appear empty or deprecated:

- `Core/Camera/`
- `Core/PointCloud/`
- `Core/Training/`
- `Features/`

These directories **must not be deleted** until Xcode target membership
is explicitly checked and cleared.

---

## 4. Pre-Deletion Verification Checklist

Before deleting or permanently removing any directory listed above,
the following checks **must be completed manually**.

### 4.1 Core/Training — Shader Safety Check

```bash
find Core/Training -type f $begin:math:text$ \-name \'\*\.metal\' \-o \-name \'\*\.glsl\' \-o \-name \'\*\.shader\' $end:math:text$

    •    If shader files exist → DO NOT DELETE
    •    Move shaders to a valid rendering module first
    •    If directory is empty or only .gitkeep → Safe to delete

⸻

4.2 Features — Xcode Compile Sources Check

Steps:
    1.    Open Xcode project
    2.    Select main app target
    3.    Go to Build Phases → Compile Sources
    4.    Search for any file under Features/

Results:
    •    If found → Remove from target before deletion
    •    If not found → Safe to delete

⸻

4.3 Core/Camera & Core/PointCloud — File Presence Check

find Core/Camera Core/PointCloud -type f 2>/dev/null | grep -v '.gitkeep'

    •    If output is empty → Safe to delete
    •    If files are found → DO NOT DELETE

⸻

5. Notes on Scope & Intent
    •    This document is not a deletion plan
    •    It is an inventory + risk map
    •    All destructive actions must occur in the appropriate PR
(e.g. PR#5 Phase 1c)

This file exists to prevent:
    •    Accidental deletion of build-linked files
    •    Silent Xcode target breakage
    •    Unreviewed structural drift

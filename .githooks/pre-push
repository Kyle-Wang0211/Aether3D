# Git pre-push hook for PR1 PIZ Detection
# WHY: Minimal hook that delegates to isolated bash script.
#      No set -u here (only in bash script), no complex logic, just exec delegation.
#
# To install: bash scripts/dev/install-githooks.sh
# To bypass: git push --no-verify (not recommended)

# WHY: exec to push_preflight.sh ensures complete isolation from zsh hooks
exec bash scripts/ci/push_preflight.sh
